# Automated_Data_Cleaning_Project_1
Automated MySQL project that cleans and maintains a U.S. household income dataset using stored procedures, scheduled events every 30 days, and triggers; ensuring clean, consistent, and up-to-date data for analysis.

## Project Overview

This project automates data cleaning for a dataset containing U.S. household income and geographic information. It uses MySQL features like **stored procedures**, **triggers**, and **events** to keep the data clean, consistent, and up-to-date with minimal manual intervention.

## Key Features

- **Stored Procedure (`Copy_and_Clean_Data`)**:
  - Creates a cleaned copy of the raw data table if it doesn't exist.
  - Copies data from the raw table to the cleaned table.
  - Removes duplicate rows based on `id` and `TimeStamp`.
  - Corrects common typos and standardizes text fields by converting values to uppercase.
  - Fixes specific known data inconsistencies (e.g., 'georia' â†’ 'Georgia').
  
- **Event Scheduler (`run_data_cleaning`)**:
  - Automatically triggers the stored procedure every **30 days** to refresh and clean the data regularly.

- **Trigger (`Transfer_Clean_Data`)**:
  - Ensures that every time new data is inserted into the raw table, the cleaning procedure is run immediately to keep the cleaned table up to date.

## How to Use

1. **Import the SQL script** into your MySQL database.
2. The stored procedure will create the cleaned data table and clean the data automatically.
3. The event scheduler will re-run the cleaning every 30 days.
4. The trigger keeps the cleaned table updated when new data is added.

## Why This Matters

Keeping data clean is critical for accurate analysis and decision-making. Automating cleaning reduces errors, saves time, and ensures consistency over time.
